# Content of this Repository

In this repository, we collect some code written while doing some databases. End of November 2020, we started working our way through "7 Databases in 7 Weeks", 2012 edition.

## The Plan

Do the exercises in docker containers. As a prerequisite, install docker on your machine.

## Postgersql

```
docker pull postgres
```
