# docker needs to be installed
docker pull postgres
docker run --name some-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d postgres
docker exec -it some-postgres /bin/bash
# now, in the container:
su - postgres
createdb book
psql book
# caution: once the container is removed, the content of the database is gone. Stop and start is ok.
# continue with postgres commands in next file

# if you want to bring some file from outside into the container:
docker cp add_event.sql some-postgres:/tmp
# similar for bringing a file from inside out
docker cp some-postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/.psql_history .
